## 📈 Impact on Scalability and Resilience

This project improved system scalability by implementing asynchronous processing via [technology used—e.g., Kafka, Celery, Azure Functions], allowing the platform to handle [X%] more concurrent requests under load.

Key resilience enhancements included:
- 🛡 Circuit breaker integration to isolate failing services
- ⚙️ Retry logic and exponential backoff for critical APIs
- 🧠 Infrastructure as Code for consistent, recoverable environments

These design decisions reduced downtime by [Y%], improved deployment reliability, and future-proofed the system for increased user growth and traffic spikes.
