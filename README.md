# GitHub as a Leadership Portfolio
# 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan Emerson  
### Engineering Leader | Distributed Systems | Platform Engineering | Fintech | Remote-First Leadership

I specialize in leading distributed engineering teams to build scalable, resilient platforms. My focus is on cloud-native architecture, developer experience, and mentoring teams to drive product impact and technical excellence.

🧰 **Current Focus Areas:**
- Building developer platforms and scalable infrastructure
- Leading architectural decisions for distributed systems
- Driving CI/CD maturity and operational reliability
- Mentoring engineers across remote teams

🌍 **Open to Remote Leadership Roles**
I’m exploring engineering leadership opportunities that align with impactful, cloud-native platforms—especially in fintech, risk management, or developer tooling spaces.
